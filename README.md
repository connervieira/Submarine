# Submarine

A simple status page to check connectivity to network targets.


## Description

Submarine is a simple self-hosted web utility that checks connectivity to a list of user-configured network targets. These targets can be just about device that the server hosting Subarmine has access to, including devices on the local network. If you have a large quantity of devices on your network, and you want to be able to quickly keep tabs on them, Submarine is a great way to do so.
